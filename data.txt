Historically, the region
 was part of the Chola, Pandya,
 Pallava and Vijayanagara kingdoms
  during various eras. The coastal
   land which then contained the
    fishing village Madrasapattinam,

    was purchased by the British East India Company from the Nayak ruler Chennapa Nayaka in the 17th century. The British garrison established the Madras city, port and built Fort St. George, the first British fortress in India and made the city as the winter capital of the Madras Presidency, a colonial province of the British Raj in the Indian subcontinent. After India gained its independence in 1947, Madras continued as the capital city of the Madras State and present-day Tamil Nadu. The city was officially renamed as Chennai in 1996.
